        First dessert that we will introduce is putu pirin. its a very popular dessert
        in Singapore. Putu pirin’ originated from Malaysia and Singapore but 
        you can also find this snack in Indonesia and Thailand. Putu pirin’ has many names such as, 
        “kue putu mangkok”, “kueh tutu” and “kue putu ayu”. But the names could differ depending on the country.   
        Putu pirin’ is a steamed rice cake that's made with melted palm sugar. 
        They are made by grinding rice into flour consistency that's later then mixed with salt. 
        The mixture is then molded in a special tutu mold that has a shape of flower(or round form 
        depending on where you're buying it). It's filled with gula melaka(palm sugar) and grated coconut.  
        Because the flour on its own doesn't have much flavor, it goes well with the palm sugar. To give it more taste.

        What does putu pirin’ taste like? 
        The light dessert is soft, fluffy, and spongy when they are warm. 
        They tend to harden and dry out once they cool down or sit longer at room temperature. 
        That's why you need to quickly eat them the moment you're done cooking or at least the same day. 
        Because the texture tends to dry out and it wont taste as good as it was the first day. 
        So make sure to just make a small statch so you can enjoy this dessert even more.
